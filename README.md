# Prevent Roblox from disconnecting after 20 minutes.
Creating this macro for this purpose allows you to AFK in Roblox while working or watching movies without needing to switch tabs back to Roblox and send input. 

In other words, you can watch a full episode longer than 20 minutes without having to click back into Roblox.

To use it, you need to install autohotkey v2 on your computer.

Open the macro while Roblox is starting, and you’re good to go!

[Notes]
- tempBlockInput is enable by default, so it's need to open with administrator, you can turn it off in script.
- download or open exe file can get a warning by Windows Security due to no code-signing certificate
- you can check source code of exe file by right click on it and open with vscode then scrolldown and there it is.
- with exe file, you need to open it with administrator once before you can edit tempBlockInput in .ini file.
